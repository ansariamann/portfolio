# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for a modern portfolio website for a junior software developer. The website will be built using Next.js 14 with TypeScript, featuring smooth animations powered by Framer Motion, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional appearance that appeals to recruiters and hiring managers.

## Architecture

- CSS Modules for component-specific styles when needed
- Custom CSS variables for theme management

**Animation & Interactions:**

- Framer Motion for declarative animations and gesture handling
- React Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- CSS transforms and transitions for performance-optimized animations

**Performance & Optimization:**

- Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Web Vitals monitoring for performance tracking

**Form Handling:**

- React Hook Form for efficient form management
- Zod for schema validation
- EmailJS or similar service for contact form submissions

- Professional headshot with subtle parallax effect
- Call-to-action buttons with micro-interactions
- Background with animated geometric shapes or particles

**About Section:**

- Personal introduction with fade-in animations
- Professional timeline or journey visualization
- Animated statistics or achievements counter

**Skills Section (Unique Presentation):**

- Interactive skill visualization options:
  - Animated skill cards that flip to show proficiency levels
  - Floating skill bubbles with size based on experience
  - Code editor mockup showing different languages
  - Animated progress rings or bars with staggered animations
- Technology stack grouped by categories (Frontend, Backend, Tools)
- Hover effects revealing additional details about each skill

**Projects Section:**

- Grid layout with animated project cards
- Hover effects revealing project details overlay
- Modal or expanded view for detailed project information
- Filter/category system with smooth transitions
- Links to live demos and GitHub repositories with animated icons

### Animation System

**Scroll Animations:**

- Intersection Observer-based reveal animations
- Staggered animations for lists and grids
- Parallax effects for background elements
- Progress indicators showing scroll position

**Micro-interactions:**

- Button hover states with scale and color transitions
- Form input focus animations
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Success/error message animations

## Data Models

### Project Interface

```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  longDescription?: string;
  technologies: string[];
  category: "web" | "mobile" | "desktop" | "other";
  images: string[];
  liveUrl?: string;
  githubUrl: string;
  featured: boolean;
  completedDate: Date;
}
```

### Skill Interface

```typescript
interface Skill {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: "frontend" | "backend" | "tools" | "languages";
  proficiency: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  icon: string;
  description?: string;
  yearsOfExperience?: number;
}
```

### Contact Form Interface

```typescript
interface ContactForm {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  company?: string;
  subject: string;
  message: string;
}
```

## Visual Design System

### Color Palette

- Primary: Modern blue (#3B82F6) for professional appeal
- Secondary: Complementary purple (#8B5CF6) for accents
- Neutral: Gray scale (#F8FAFC to #1E293B) for text and backgrounds
- Success: Green (#10B981) for positive actions
- Warning: Amber (#F59E0B) for attention

### Typography

- Headings: Inter or Poppins for modern, clean appearance
- Body: System font stack for optimal readability
- Code: JetBrains Mono for technical content

### Imagery Strategy

- Hero background: Abstract tech-themed illustrations or geometric patterns
- Project screenshots: High-quality mockups with device frames
- Skill icons: Consistent icon set (Heroicons, Lucide, or custom SVGs)
- About section: Professional headshot with subtle background blur

## Error Handling

### Form Validation

- Real-time validation with smooth error message animations
- Field-level validation with immediate feedback
- Success states with confirmation animations
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms

### Image Loading

- Skeleton loading states for images
- Fallback images for broken links
- Progressive image loading with blur-to-sharp transitions
- Error boundaries for component failures

### Performance Fallbacks

- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Loading states for slow network connections
- Error pages with navigation back to main content

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Animation testing with Framer Motion test utilities
- Form validation testing with various input scenarios
- Utility function testing for data processing

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end user flows with Playwright or Cypress
- Contact form submission testing
